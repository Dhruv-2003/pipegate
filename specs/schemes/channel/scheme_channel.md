# Scheme: `channel`

## Summary

Payment channels enable high-frequency micropayments between API consumers and providers by creating off-chain payment commitments backed on-chain escrow. This scheme is ideal for use cases requiring many API calls with minimal per-transaction costs.

## Use Cases

- **High-frequency API access**: Make thousands of API calls without individual gas fees for each request
- **Micropayment workflows**: Pay precise amounts per API request (e.g., $0.001 per call) with sub-cent granularity
- **Trusted recurring payments**: Establish ongoing payment relationships with API providers for regular access
- **Batch settlement**: Accumulate many small payments and settle them in a single on-chain transaction
- **Real-time services**: Enable immediate API access with cryptographic payment commitments
- **IoT and automated systems**: Support machine-to-machine payments for automated API consumption

## Appendix

Payment channels require initial setup through smart contract deployment and provider registration. The scheme supports any ERC-20 token and operates on EVM-compatible networks. State management occurs both client-side and server-side with in-memory storage, requiring consideration for persistence and recovery mechanisms.
